        I'm a developer based in Maidstone, just outside London, with a passion for creating 
        efficient and user-friendly web applications. My background in 
        purchasing allowed me to work on my problem-solving skills, which I now apply to my development projects. I'm 
        proficient in React, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, with hands-on experience in 
        building responsive web apps like SimpliStock.
